blueprint:
  name: Cleanup database (Time Trigger)
  description: >-
    Cleans up data by by purging entities which log too much data but which you
    want to keep the long term statistics of, then (optionally) optimises the database.
    Use recorder excludes for entities which you don't care about.
  domain: automation

    trigger_time:
      name: Trigger Time
      description: The time when you want this automation to run (default 3:22AM).

      default: "03:22:00"

      name: Days to Keep
      description: >-
        How many days of data to keep (default 1) - you may keep more if you really 
        want more fine data but this will increase your database size.
      selector:

    repack_enable:
      name: Enable Repack
      description: >-
        Enable repacking of the database (this will optimise and hopefully shrink your database size).
        This step is optional and depending on database size may cause a significant performance impact
        as the database is rewritten. Disable this to reduce disk hits. Enabled by default.
